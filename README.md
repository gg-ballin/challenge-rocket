### Challenge notes

This challenge was made while sharing screen and the supervision of a Senior Developer acting as a Product Owner. As the interview was 2 hours long, 
I couldn't implement a library for state management (I use Redux) or for navigation (React Navigation) so I had to improvise on the go using a Modal instead of a navigation system to show the detail of each launch.

The challenge consisted in fetching data from an endpoint (https://api.spacexdata.com/v4/launches), rendering the data required in the mock (image attached) and in the meantime, explain what I'm doing in realtime,
making questions about what does the PO needs to see in the screen of the phone.
